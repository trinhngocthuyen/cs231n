Self-study CS231n (Convolutional Neural Network for Visual Recognition)

This repo is created as a hub of notes and assignments of the course CS231n offered by Stanford.
The course could be found at http://cs231n.stanford.edu.

Note:
- Primarily based on 2017 materials (notes, assignments...)
- ~However, the video lectures of spring 2017 have not yet publicly [released](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs231n/comments/67izzs/youtube_videos_of_lectures_for_spring_2017/).
So, I currently follow those of [2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC), published by Andrej.~ --> [Updated] [2017 video lectures have been released.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv)
